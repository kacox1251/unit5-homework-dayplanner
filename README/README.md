# unit5-homework-dayplanner

## Description

This is the functional day planner for the Unit 5 homework.
For this homework I had to use Jquery as well as Moment.js to create a functional day planner. Jquery is very convenient to use for writing quick and effective Javascript. The hardnest part of this homework was trying to use Moment.js. It is such a huge tool to get ahold of and I would love to spend more time to study it in order to use it more effectively.

## Usage

This page allows you to set up your own working day planner. You can see the current day diaplayed above the hours as well as lines containing the hours for an average American work day. In each line there is a text input that allows you to type in your appointments or plans for the day at that time. When you click the save button your plans get saved into local storage and you can see them displayed until you clear them. The planner also shows when hours are past, current, and future. The past hours are diaplayed with no color, the current hour is displayed as red, and the future hours are displayed as green.
