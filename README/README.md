# unit5-homework-dayplanner

## Description

This is the password generator for the Unit 3 homework.
for this homework I needed to combine HTML, CSS, and JS. This project demonstrates my skills using Javascript. Javascript really brings webpages to life. It feels like half of the time I understand JS and can accomplish a lot. The other half of the time it is really hard for me to figure out why things aren't working. I felt like I was on the right path with this project and when it came down to it the characters for the password weren't generating like they were supposed to.

## Usage

This page allows you to set up your own working day planner. You can see the current day diaplayed above the hours as well as lines containing the hours for an average American work day. In each line there is a text input that allows you to type in your appointments or plans for the day at that time. When you click the save button your plans get saved into local storage and you can see them displayed until you clear them. The planner also shows when hours are past, current, and future. The past hours are diaplayed with no color, the current hour is displayed as red, and the future hours are displayed as green.
